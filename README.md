## OMSCS 7210 Quick Starter

This is a small tool built by Daniel Gleason as extra credit for the distributed systems course at Georgia Tech.

The intention of this tool is to make it easier for students to setup a virtual machine for the class.


#### It comes preloaded with:
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Java 8
* IntelliJ


#### Development Requirements:
* PowerShell Latest Version
* Python >= 3.10.9
* Poetry package manager for python


#### How to setup this tool:
1. Run setup.ps1
2. There will be an executable built in dist/ which you can distribute to users.
3. Each executable will have to be built for each platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).
4. The executable has only been tested on MacOS, but should work on Windows and Linux as well.
